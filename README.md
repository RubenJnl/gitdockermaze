# Git Docker Maze 
 
This is basically a puzzle that you can solve by using some basic Git and Docker skills: 
- Clone this repository 
- Checkout the branch named branch-a 
- Rebase on master 
- Checkout the master branch 
- Merge the branch named branch-a to the current branch 
- Merge (with --squash) the branch named branch-b to the current branch 
- Use docker compose to run from the root of the repository 
- Observe the message that is output 
 
If the message makes sense, then you have done it!
